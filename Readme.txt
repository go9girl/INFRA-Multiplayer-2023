how to install
later i will add a .bat file to do this automaticly

take all the files inside of this .zip file and extract them into another folder

open steam and goto INFRA>SETTINGS>MANAGE>BROWSE LOCAL FILES

next copy the following folders to the following places, if it asks to replace any files click NO or it will break infra

Drag hL2mp into the main folder in other words common/infra just place it there

next drag the Bin folder into the bin folder, do NOT replace any files

drag the platform folder into the same directory as the hL2 folder common/infra
do the same for the sdktools folder 

open the source test folder

copy the stuff in bin into the infra bin

open the infra folder and do the same for the cfg files
and do the same for the recource folder, find it and place it in recource

lauch infra

once you do windows firewall will pop up click "allow"

then close infra

on steam go to INFRA>SETTINGS>PROPERTYS>GENERAL then under launch option type: -console
now the console should launch when you start the game

now look through the console, in it there should be an ip in green for ex: 127.0.0.1:2702 
in the console type for ex: Connect 127.0.0.1:2702 
if it works your screen will flash back and the game should hang, at this point you know it works and you can now close it

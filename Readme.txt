how to install
later i will add a .bat file to do this automaticly

Download the infra.zip file from 0.0 release

open steam and goto INFRA>SETTINGS>MANAGE>BROWSE LOCAL FILES

next
extract the infra.zip

copy the contents into common/infra

Merge but DO NOT REPLACE skip instead

lauch infra

once you do windows firewall will pop up click "allow"

then close infra

on steam go to INFRA>SETTINGS>PROPERTYS>GENERAL then under launch option type: -console
now the console should launch when you start the game

now look through the console, in it there should be an ip in green for ex: 127.0.0.1:2702 
in the console type for ex: Connect 127.0.0.1:2702 
if it works your screen will flash back and the game should hang, at this point you know it works and you can now close it
